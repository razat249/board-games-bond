            <p>
              Decrypto is a team-based game of code-breaking and communications where players attempt to transmit coded messages to their teammates without letting the opposing team intercept them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each team has their own screen with four words, numbered 1-4, visible only to them. The clue giver must help their teammates guess a sequence of three numbers by giving three clues that relate to their team's words.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, the opposing team will be trying to figure out the other team's secret words by watching what clues are given for which sequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first team to intercept two communications or the first team to get two miscommunications loses the game.
            </p>
